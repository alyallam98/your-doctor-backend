Operations Flow:
Create Category

GraphQL Resolver (createCategory):
Receives an input payload containing name and an optional description.
Input is validated using DTOs (with class-validator ensuring required fields are present).
Service (createCategory):
Checks the repository to see if a category with the same name already exists (filtering out soft-deleted records).
If a duplicate is found, a BadRequestException is thrown.
If validation passes, the service delegates to the repository to create a new Category document.
Repository:
Inserts a new document into MongoDB with isDeleted set to false and auto-generated timestamps.
Result:
The newly created category is returned to the client.
Update Category

GraphQL Resolver (updateCategory):
Receives the category id along with updated fields.
Service (updateCategory):
Validates the updated data, ensuring that if the name is being changed, no other category (excluding the current one) already uses the new name.
If validation fails, an exception is thrown.
Calls the repository to update the document.
Repository:
Uses a findOneAndUpdate operation to modify the document and returns the updated record.
Result:
The updated category is sent back to the client.
Delete Category (Soft Delete)

GraphQL Resolver (deleteCategory):
Receives the category id.
Service (deleteCategory):
Delegates the deletion request to the repository.
Repository:
Instead of removing the document, it sets isDeleted to true via a findOneAndUpdate operation.
Result:
The soft-deleted category is returned, confirming the deletion.
Get Category

GraphQL Resolver (getCategory):
Receives a category id as input.
Service (getCategory):
Retrieves the category from the repository (ensuring the record is not soft-deleted).
If no category is found, an error is thrown.
Repository:
Performs a query filtering by \_id and isDeleted: false.
Result:
The category details are returned to the client.
List Categories

GraphQL Resolver (listCategories):
Accepts pagination parameters (skip and limit) and an optional filter (e.g., partial name matching).
Service (listCategories):
Passes these parameters to the repository.
Repository:
Returns a list of categories that match the filter and are not soft-deleted.
Result:
A paginated, filtered list of categories is provided to the client.
Optimization Note:
Frequently requested lists may be cached (e.g., via Redis) for performance. 2. Branch Module
Objective: Manage rental locations (branches) including detailed address, contact information, operating hours, and manager assignments.

Operations Flow:
Create Branch

GraphQL Resolver (createBranch):
Receives input containing branch name, composite address (street, city, state, zip, country), contact information, and operatingHours.
Service (createBranch):
Validates that no branch with the same name exists in the specified city to avoid duplicates.
Checks that the provided operating hours are logical (i.e., the open time is before the close time).
On successful validation, forwards the request to the repository.
Repository:
Inserts a new Branch document into MongoDB with proper indexing (e.g., compound index on name and city) and default isDeleted: false.
Result:
The newly created branch is returned.
Update Branch

GraphQL Resolver (updateBranch):
Receives the branch id and updated input.
Service (updateBranch):
Checks for possible duplicate branch names within the same city if the name is changed.
Validates any changes to operating hours.
Delegates update logic to the repository.
Repository:
Uses a findOneAndUpdate operation to update the branch and returns the updated document.
Result:
The updated branch information is returned to the client.
Delete Branch (Soft Delete)

GraphQL Resolver (deleteBranch):
Receives the branch id.
Service (deleteBranch):
Calls the repository to perform a soft delete.
Repository:
Sets the branch's isDeleted flag to true via an update operation.
Result:
The soft-deleted branch is confirmed to the client.
Get Branch

GraphQL Resolver (getBranch):
Receives a branch id.
Service (getBranch):
Retrieves the branch by ID, ensuring that related fields (such as the manager) are populated.
Repository:
Queries the database filtering out soft-deleted branches.
Result:
The branch details, including manager data, are returned.
List Branches

GraphQL Resolver (listBranches):
Accepts pagination parameters and an optional filter (e.g., filtering by branch name or city).
Service (listBranches):
Forwards these parameters to the repository.
Repository:
Returns a filtered, paginated list of branches.
Result:
The branch list is provided to the client.
Assign Manager to Branch

GraphQL Resolver (assignManagerToBranch):
Receives a branchId and a managerId.
Service (assignManagerToBranch):
Optionally checks that the provided user has the role “Branch Manager” (this check can be enhanced with further authorization logic).
Delegates the manager assignment to the repository.
Repository:
Updates the branch’s manager field with the provided manager ID.
Result:
The branch with the newly assigned manager is returned. 3. Brand Module
Objective: Manage car brands (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford) with a focus on uniqueness and performance through indexing.

Operations Flow:
Create Brand

GraphQL Resolver (createBrand):
Receives an input payload containing name and an optional countryOfOrigin.
Service (createBrand):
Checks that no other brand with the same name exists.
Throws an error if a duplicate is detected.
Delegates creation to the repository on successful validation.
Repository:
Inserts a new Brand document into MongoDB, enforcing uniqueness via indexes.
Result:
The newly created brand is returned to the client.
Update Brand

GraphQL Resolver (updateBrand):
Receives the brand id and update input.
Service (updateBrand):
Validates that if the brand name is updated, the new name is unique.
Calls the repository to update the document.
Repository:
Updates the brand using a findOneAndUpdate operation.
Result:
The updated brand details are returned.
Delete Brand (Soft Delete)

GraphQL Resolver (deleteBrand):
Receives the brand id.
Service (deleteBrand):
Delegates the soft deletion to the repository.
Repository:
Updates the document’s isDeleted flag to true.
Result:
The soft-deleted brand is confirmed and returned.
Get Brand

GraphQL Resolver (getBrand):
Receives the brand id.
Service (getBrand):
Retrieves brand details via the repository (ensuring the record is not soft-deleted).
Repository:
Executes a query filtering by \_id and isDeleted: false.
Result:
The brand details are provided to the client.
List Brands

GraphQL Resolver (listBrands):
Accepts pagination parameters and an optional filter (e.g., partial name match).
Service (listBrands):
Forwards these parameters to the repository.
Repository:
Returns a list of non-deleted brands, using MongoDB’s pagination methods (.skip() and .limit()) and applying indexes for performance.
Result:
A paginated list of brands is returned.
Cross-Cutting Business Logic & Best Practices
Data Validation (DTOs & Class-Validator)

Every incoming GraphQL request uses DTOs to validate data before processing.
Uniqueness is enforced (e.g., for Category.name and Brand.name) to avoid duplicates.
Soft Delete Strategy

Instead of permanently deleting records, the isDeleted flag is set to true.
All queries filter out these records to maintain data integrity while allowing potential recovery.
Caching Optimization

Frequently accessed queries (such as listing categories) may be cached using Redis to reduce database load and improve response times.
Indexing & Query Performance

MongoDB indexes (e.g., on name and composite fields like address.city) are used to accelerate queries, especially those involving filtering and pagination.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

In the Branch module, the assignment of a manager is gated by business logic to ensure that only users with the "Branch Manager" role can be assigned.
Additional authorization checks can be integrated into the service layer.
GraphQL Pagination & Filtering

List queries across modules support pagination (skip, limit) and filtering (using regex for partial matches), enabling efficient and scalable data retrieval.
Modular & Layered Architecture

Each module (Category, Branch, Brand) is self-contained with its own GraphQL resolvers, services, and repository abstractions.
This separation of concerns facilitates maintainability, testing, and future scalability.
Final Summary
This business logic script details how our enterprise system manages categories, branches, and brands:

Resolvers serve as the entry points that map GraphQL queries/mutations to business operations.
Services enforce business rules (e.g., uniqueness, logical validations) and manage the workflow.
Repositories abstract away MongoDB (Mongoose) operations, applying soft delete logic, indexing, and pagination.
Together, these layers form a robust, scalable backend architecture using NestJS, Mongoose, and GraphQL—ready for enterprise applications.

This comprehensive script provides a clear blueprint for how the code functions end-to-end while ensuring best practices in data validation, performance, and maintainability are followed throughout.
